# OVERITE
## Pipeline vandalization System using Blockchain Technology

This project aims to leverage Blockchain technology to safeguard pipelines from acts of vandalism. By employing Blockchain's secure and decentralized framework, the system intends to create a tamper-resistant method to monitor, track, and prevent unauthorized access or damage to pipelines. Through this initiative, the project endeavors to enhance the security and integrity of vital infrastructure while minimizing the risks associated with potential sabotage.

There are four basic feature components of this project, namely:

|**Component** | **Description** |
|---|---|
|**UI/UX Design**| *responsible for crafting interfaces that not only look good but also provide a seamless and satisfying experience for users interacting with the system or application.* |
|**Frontend Development**| *responsible for building the client-side of websites or applications, translating designs into functional and interactive user interfaces using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.* |

This arm of this project is set to cover the frontend and backend development systems
